In this\ncontext, the use of artificial intelligence and its impact on privacy\nwill be addressed.\nLearning outcomes and\nqualification goals\nStudents will…\n• have a basic knowledge on the applicability of the General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR) and its basic principles;\n• be aware of privacy issues and potential legal limitations when\nprocessing data;\n• be aware of current challenges to the existing privacy\n• have an understanding why privacy issues are treated differently\nin Europe and the U.S.;\n• paradigms by big data and big data analytics;\n• be aware of currently discussed new approaches to privacy (e.g.,\nprivacy by design);\n• be aware of ethical issues of using personal as well as non-\npersonal data\n• be aware of the chances and challenges the use of artificial\nintelligence will bring",

    "aim_of_module": "As “big data” and “algorithms” affect our daily communication, new\nresearch questions arise at the intersection between societies and\ntechnologies. Many of these questions are of great social relevance\nand are therefore prominently discussed both by researchers and in\nthe media. One outstanding, recent example from the field of\nmedia psychology is a rising interest in the association of (social)\nmedia use and mental health. Another example, from the realm of\npolitical communication, is the ongoing debate about the role of\nnew communication technologies during political campaigns (e.g.,\nto spread disinformation). Both questions revolve around the\nprocess of communication. Sound research in this area thus\nrequires both a solid foundation from communication theory as\nwell as expertise in handling new and “big” data. To close this gap,\nthe growing discipline of Computational Communication Science\n(CCS) takes on a combinatory perspective between social and\ncomputer science. The present course will provide an overview\nabout the current state of CCS and intends to motivate students to\napproach pressing social questions from a different perspective.\nLearning outcomes and\nqualification goals\nExpertise:\nAfter the course the students are aware of the typical research\ntopics and questions in automated media content analyses and the\ndifferent methodological approaches for tackling them; they know\nthe different methods’ potentials, limitations, and typical fields of\napplication; they are able to develop their own specific research\nquestions and can make an informed decision about which method\nto apply for answering it (MK3).\n\nMethodological competence:\nStudents are able to independently develop a research question\nand design in the area of automated media content analysis and can\nconduct a respective analysis using one of the different\nmethodological ap-proaches introduced in the exercise; they are\nable to document the results of their analyses in a research report\nand reflect upon their find-ings’ limitations with regards to\nreliability and validity.\n(MF1, MF2, MF3, MF4, MF5)\nPersonal competence:\nThe course supports students to develop problem-solving\ncompetences with regards to research-design oriented questions.\nBy solving exercises independently, the transfer of the learned\nmaterial to related questions is promoted and self-confidence with\nregards to research-oriented tasks is gathered (MKO3).",
